# Why I chose Bliss as the image for 2001

2001 was a very diverse year. A lot happened, but there isn't very many things that can come to mind for a wallpaper representing the year. The September 11th attacks would be recognizable, but it isn't a positive thing to look back on. I couldn't choose the Mac OS X 1.0 wallpaper, as it just isn't as notable in comparison, although it does look very good. However, Bliss is one of the most iconic photos of all time, due in large part to Windows XP. I feel that Bliss is the best way to represent 2001.

Future todo: change the texture of 2001 CE to Tahoma font with the Aqua style (for "2001") and cheetah texture with a monotype font for "CE" so that MacOS and Linux also gets representation (Linux, because the GIMP cheetah texture can be both a representation of free software, and non-free software (MacOS))
