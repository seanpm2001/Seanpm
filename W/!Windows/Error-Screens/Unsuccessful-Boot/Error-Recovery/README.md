# Unsuccessful Windows 7 boot image

I was playing around with GIMP late at night and made a very low quality image of a modified Windows error screen with a PNG from a PDF of my first daily journal. On Pi Day 2023, I remastered the image with a higher quality sample, unfortunately, I couldn't find anything higher resolution than `624x296` (not even 720p) that wasn't a camera taking a picture of a screen.

This is as high quality as I can get for now. I don't know why this project was important enough for a remaster, but it has been done.
