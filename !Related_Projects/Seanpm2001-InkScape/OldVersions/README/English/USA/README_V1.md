## About

`Seanpm2001-InkScape` is a repository of mine related to the Inkscape vector graphics software. It hosts all of my SVG designs made with the software, and also displays PNG images of Inkscape itself, either documenting what Inkscape looks like, or documenting what the SVG file looks like within InkScape.
