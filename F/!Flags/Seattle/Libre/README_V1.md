# New Libre flag of Seattle

## Motivation

- Seattles current flag doesn't look very symmetrical, and lacks notability, it seems more like a flag for New York, or somewhere else.
- The current flag is copyrighted and trademarked, and a Libre version is needed for everyone to use.
- I love Seattle (even though I don't live there at the moment) it is the biggest city I have been to in my life to date. Seattle deserves better.

## Design

- The space needle is in the center, and is surrounded by the city skyline, with a musical symbol in the top left corner to represent Seattles musical history, and a seal of Washington on the top right corner to represent the state
- More symbols can be added
- For the background, a medium blue is in use to represent the sea that Seattle is next to, and a white oval is in the center, so that the space needle and other symbols look better on the flag, and also to represent the 

## Notes

- When asking questions about what to put on the flag, I was told that Seattle had a king, known as King Seattle. I may have been told a joke, or there may have been an error, as I cannot find anything online about a king of Seattle.
- I want to keep this flag neutral and respectful, because Seattle was inhabited by Native Americans for ~4000 years before American settlers came along. If there is a way to represent this (such as the Duwamish people) it should be added to the bottom left and/or bottom right corner
- This flag is in early development, it is going to look a lot better than it is right now
- This flag will be free of copyright and trademarks
