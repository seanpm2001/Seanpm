`SeansLifeArchive_Images_GNOME_GIMP` is a repository of mine related to the GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) raster graphics software. It displays views of me editing my graphic designs, made with the software, and also displays PNG images of GIMP itself, either documenting what GIMP looks like, or documenting what the Raster file looks like within GIMP.
