# Why aren't you using the SVG version?

> The SVG version of the Marko logo contains Pantone colors, which aren't compatible with Free Software, such as GIMP, due to their Copyright (Pantone prevents people from using some 20000 colors without paying a licensing fee, these colors are known as Pantone Colors) The first 2 colors of the logo displayed incorrectly when I tried to import them, with the first 2 shapes being shaded black. The PNG version works fine, so I used it instead.
