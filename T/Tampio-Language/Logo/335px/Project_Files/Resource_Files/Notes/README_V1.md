# Tampio logo

## Development

I didn't know what else to do for the logo, so I chose the profile picture of the languages creator [:octocat: `@fergusq`](https://github.com/ferqusq/) and used it as the backdrop, as it is a vibrant logo. The language name was added in blue, with a white line below it. These 2 colors represent 🇫🇮️ Finland, since this is a Finnish language programming language.
